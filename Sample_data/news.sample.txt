Every manager has their own way of handling players' mistakes, and I'm sure Robin will lay down the law behind closed doors or let his sheriff, Mark Parent, carry out his message. This staff pays close attention to details, so I don't see many shortcomings go unnoticed. Sending Fukudome out there immediately might have lost Rios for quite a while. There are other ways to send a message to a player without showing him up.

The group argues that Social Security doesn't contribute to the deficit, which is incorrect. The program paid more in benefits last year than it collected in taxes, and that gap will grow over time. More importantly, by 2037, Social Security won't have enough money to pay its promised benefits, which means today's 50-year-olds are looking at a 25 percent benefit cut in their mid-70s.

Recognizing this challenge, a growing group of business leaders, scientists and economists has settled on a target for increased federal energy R&D: $15 billion, compared to the current level of about $3 billion. The consensus extends from a coalition of business titans including Bill Gates and GE Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt, to dozens of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, to the president's chief technology advisers. This investment, they argue, can drive down the price of low-carbon energy, help regain U.S. clean-tech leadership and spur the development of entirely new industries. The Obama administration's latest budget proposes a $750 million increase in annual energy innovation spending -- a critical first step.

And I'm supposed to believe that attendance depends on Bernie Miklasz or Bryan Burwell or local TV-radio guys hyping the Billikens? Please.

Actually it works the other way around: the team and the fans create the buzz and the media follows. It's predictable.

For Kitzhaber, part of the attractiveness of seeking an unprecedented third term as governor was the prospect of working with a strong Democratic majority in the Legislature.

I have been dating a widow for about three months. She was married for 10 years before and has three girls, ages 9, 7 and 4. I met and get along with the two younger ones, but the older one is quite challenging.

How can I?

First of all, don't be too fixated on price. There's an acceptable price range for wines that come in a bottle, and I think the sweet spot is $8-$18. There is a tremendous inventory of choice in this range. There are many wines of true merit priced higher, but it's not often comfortable to spend that much. (That said, there is no better time than now to buy higher-end boutique wines. The economy has made them more available than in good times. Stock up.)

In education we teach more than just reading, writing, and math. We also teach our children to work together, support one another and to be compassionate. When there is a problem to be solved, we teach them to sit down together and figure it out by listening and being respectful of one another's opinion. After all, everyone has a right to be heard because you never know, you might just learn something that changes your perception of a problem, understand someone else's point of view or even reframe a core belief. Listening to seek understanding is a higher order skill, a life skill we teach our children.

The present integrates our past. The present can lead us to insights about the past much more so that remembering and analyzing past experience.

Across the back of the exhibit is a large replica of the bridge of the Enterprise. Yep, you can sit in a version of Capt. James T. Kirk's command chair.

If Phillips doesn't show visitors more of the Chesapeake than the crab dishes, that's not so different from almost every other seafood restaurant in town. But there's a big Baltimore grace note in the dessert course, a tremendously delicious pie made from Berger cookies. It's so good that you'll hardly notice the other desserts you ordered, decent examples of the things that every restaurant has — Key lime pie, chocolate lava cake and particularly buttery bread pudding.

"It really decimated the walleye population," added Ken Kehmeier, a senior biologist out of Fort Collins. "But the thing I think is real important is that we're starting to see the results of our stocking from that 2007 year class now because they're 4-5 years old."

But right now the team is a dysfunctional mess. Vander Weide mysteriously disappeared before the season began. The franchise player threw the GM under the bus earlier this season and went to management about getting the coach fired.

Government agencies increasingly are putting out report cards on cars, schools, restaurants and other offerings to help consumers sort among them.

But observers say if DiCianni and Grasso win in November and are pressured to step down as mayors - a possibility ever since DuPage County State's Attorney Robert Berlin crafted a legal opinion that found such dual roles are "incompatible" - it could make it easier for someone to come after Silvestri or Tobolski, the mayor of McCook since 2007 and a Cook County commissioner since 2010.

Of course, there are other potential kinds of electoral fraud; crooked poll workers, for example, could record votes in the names of citizens who actually stayed home. Election officials could design ballots in a way that worked to a specific candidate's advantage or disadvantage (see Florida, 2000).

At these venues, and smaller ones that Pollstar doesn't track, managers say the surge in sales isn't because of a higher number of shows or more expensive tickets. They say they owe their good fortune to a combination of factors, starting with competing more aggressively with other venues.
A: No. No way. (Storm and) the Balls was a cabaret act, in a way. We'd tell stories and every week I'd do something stupid and make fun of myself. So I thought of doing more of a revue with music, and I'd make fun of myself as this messed-up stripper character.

"But since Brown and the Democrats rammed the bill into law on a party-line vote, Ohio's unemployment rate has risen to 9.6 percent, above the national average.”

The phrase—battling everything—could have been the mantra for Game of Thrones’ second season on screen and off. Based on New Mexico novelist George R.R. Martin’s fantasy-book series A Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones follows the brutal quest for power among several ruling families in a sprawling mythical kingdom. Its initial 10-episode series order was considered a risky move for a premium network best known for contemporary shows like The Sopranos and Sex and the City. Though the sexy vampire drama True Blood proved that a supernatural series could succeed on the network, the high-fantasy genre was still considered so...so...nerdy. Television’s last hit fantasy series was the syndicated Xena: Warrior Princess, and no TV show had ever pulled off combining swords, sorcery, and R-rated sex and violence. When Thrones premiered to lavish critical praise last April, the network granted it a quick renewal. “Our biggest goal is passionate engagement,” says HBO programming chief Michael Lombardo. “And Thrones has rabidly passionate viewers.” But only about 2.2 million people tuned in for the initial airing, which isn’t so hot when a network spends a reported $50–60 million on a project. Then something strange happened. Fueled by word-of-mouth buzz, Thrones’ ratings went up. And up. Martin’s novels leaped onto best-seller lists, moving a staggering 8.4 million copies in 2011, including his newest Song of Ice and Fire installment, A Dance With Dragons.

Whether it's these miserly, miserable coots getting their hearts warmed (or, in the Grinch's case, growing three sizes), George Bailey having second thoughts about suicide in It's a Wonderful Life or Doris Walker coming around to believing in Santa in Miracle on 34th Street, the transformation of a central character is a holiday tradition, particularly in movies.

Then continue, and in no time you'll be in San Blas, a hillside barrio that spills down to the plaza and where global visitors mingle with Cuzco's artistic types. Grab a snack at the tiny, orange-walled Café de Mama Oli (199 Plazoleta Nazarenas), and peek at the lobby of the Hotel Monasterio, where rates routinely run $400 and up a night. This old monastery, built in the 1590s, was converted 47 years ago into a lodging with two courtyards and museum-worthy art. (If you go in March, stay three nights and pay upfront, you can get rooms here for as little as $235.) Then have a look at the Amaru Hostal, a block away, with pleasant, modest rooms for about $50 a night. (I wish I'd slept there instead of at the Andina Classic Cuzco Plaza, where I paid about $140 for a tiny room.)
A number of young adults who were there said Lamere offered them a substance he said would cause "hallucinations," the document said. He told people the drug was 2C-I, a substance similar to 2C-E. Lamere offered the drug to anybody who wanted it, the document said.

The instructions that come with the grain packages are a useful guide, but they are not infallible. Some claim a grain needs to be soaked overnight before cooking — as you would beans. In my experience, that makes only a minimal difference in cooking time and doesn't improve the final quality of the grain at all.

* And as a general business practice you can't sign No. 2 or No. 3 receivers and pay them No. 1 money. That's a bad investment. Those No. 2s and No. 3s are better than what the Rams have, but how far do you go to sign them? It's an interesting question. But free-agent history tells us that some of the worst mistakes have been made by teams overpaying WRs in the hope that they'll become something more, something better, than they really are.

Four years after winning the White House, Obama is dealing with a different economic and political reality as he seeks re-election.

The focus on likability is a mistake. It's a mistake, first, for Democrats if they believe likability will be enough for Mr. Obama to win re-election come November. It's even more of a mistake for those Republicans who believe that the only way to defeat the president is to get fellow Americans to dislike him as much as they do.

"This is being billed as a free event, and it is, but the purpose of it is to sign kids up for for-pay events in other locations," said BBB investigator Bill Smith.
A lot of people are curious about what "spiritual direction" means. When asked to define spiritual direction and to draw a portrait of what it looks like, I came up with the analogy of sorting through a "junk drawer"-you know, that place in a house (my house anyway) that gets filled up with a lot of tangled-up string and old tickets stubs, half-used batteries and gummy nickels, rubber bands and takeout menus.
Fed officials are debating how much further to go to signal a likely timetable for any rate changes.

The first one is tactical but cautious, probably because he’s been burned before and carries that lesson around like a scarlet letter, and he believes that the proven way to build a contender is by taking incremental steps.

The food, well, stinks: I’ve enjoyed some of the best meals of my life from anonymous street carts in Bangkok. But at trendy Momogoose truck in Dewey Square last week, my Spicy Thai Chicken was so bland I threw it out. Then I suffered through a “Blue Man Goo” sandwich from Grilled Cheese Nation with Great Hill blue cheese — my favorite local cheese! But the thin, malnourished sandwich lacked the much-anticipated “goo” and was a bad deal at $7. It also will be a long time before I order another Chinese sausage taco from Staff Meal. At least it was only $3.

Washington must ensure U.S.-based innovation and production have the same market access in Asia and the Eurozone that foreign businesses now enjoy in U.S. markets, and that American firms are not disadvantaged by an undervalued yuan or euro.

AFC NORTH: If there was a winner to the draft, it might be Cincinnati. The Bengals got two good players who fill major needs in the first round, CB Dre Kirkpatrick and G Kevin Zeitler. Then got “droppers’’ DE Devon Still and WR Mohamed Sanu in the second and third. Pittsburgh, no surprise, also did very well. The Steelers may have rebuilt an offensive line that needed it with G David DeCastro in the first and T Mike Adams in the second. Baltimore is going to have to figure out how to use DE/LB Courtney Upshaw to make that pick work. Cleveland bought the Vikings’ bait, instead of calling their bluff and traded from No. 4 to No. 3 for Trent Richardson. But Brandon Weeden? Oh yeah that’s right Tom Heckert is the GM in Cleveland.
